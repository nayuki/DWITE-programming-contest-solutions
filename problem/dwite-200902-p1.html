		<p>
			While <strong>diff</strong> is a useful text processing utility that finds the differences between contents of files, this <em>baby diff</em> will start out as a simplistic check, counting how many of the leading characters of two lines of text are the same. The hopes and dreams of this program is to grow up into a full-fledged utility, but for now, it starts small.
		</p>

		<p>
			The input file <strong>DATA1.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of input, two lines each. Each line will be a non-empty string, less than 255 characters long.
		</p>
		<p>
			The output file <strong>OUT1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, integers 0 &lt;= i &lt;= 255 -- number of leading characters that are the same between the two lines, up to the first difference.
		</p>
		<p>
		  <em>Note:</em> that the two lines could be of different length. The counter stops before the first character that doesn't match, so two strings that start differently would have a result of 0. Make sure not to count the linebreak characters such as \n, \r, or a combination there of.
