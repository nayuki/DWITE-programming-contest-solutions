		<p>
			'Car hopping' is a common past-time of programmers that involves them hopping atop of cars parked in a lot (it gives them something to do while <a href="http://xkcd.com/303/" title="XKCD">waiting for their code to compile</a>). After having received multiple complaints, the parking-lot company decided to hire guards to stand on top of cars to prevent programmers from car hopping. However, there are certain factors the guards should take into account:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>In the lot that they are guarding there are <strong>N</strong> cars in a row, each of a certain height.</li>
			<li>Due to the heavy fog in the area, the guards can only monitor the tops of the cars that are up to <strong>S</strong> spots away from them.</li>
			<li>No guard can see past a car (no matter how close it is to them) that has a height greater than the car they are standing on.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Given the predicament they are in, the company decides to hire a programmer (one of the founders of <em>'Car hopping'</em> nonetheless!) to help them determine the minimum number of guards needed.
		</p>
		<p> 
			The input file <strong>DATA5.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases. The first line of each test case contains 2 numbers, separated by a space &lt;= <strong>N M</strong> &lt;= 1000. The <strong>N</strong>umber of cars in the lot and the <strong>M</strong>aximum distance the guards can see in the fog. The following <strong>N</strong> lines will contain a single integer 1 &lt;= <strong>H</strong> &lt;= 1000, the <strong>H</strong>eight of each car, in order.
		</p> 
		<p>
			The output file <strong>OUT5.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output. A single integer, representing the minimum number of guards necessary to monitor the lot for each corresponding case.

		</div> 
		<p>
			<em>Notes:</em> in the first case, a single guard can be placed on the middle car, and the range of 2 in each direction will cover the entire lot. In the second case, such strategy will not work, as a guard in the middle (height 3) is blocked by the following car (height 4) from monitoring the last car of the lot.
