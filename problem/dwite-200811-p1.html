		<p>
			A house key, is essentially a physical encoding of a digital key, where different heights of teeth represent different digits. If one could read this digital equivalent (lets say from a to-scale photograph), then the physical key itself is not needed to create a copy. Lets imagine that we are not lock-picking our way into some place we shouldn't be at, but instead are running a legitimate locksmith business, maintaining a machine that cuts new copies of keys. We need to write some software that will scan the image of a key, and extract the heights of the teeth.

		<p>
			The input file <strong>DATA1.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of input. Each line is 5 characters long, and there are 7 lines per set. There is an additional whitespace line separating each set. Dot . will be the empty space character in the "image", number sign # is a part of the key. Each set of #s is continuous, but there could be a line of input with no #s at all.
		</p>
		<p>
			The output file <strong>OUT1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each a 7 digit number, where each digit matches the height of the tooth on the corresponding line in the key. The top-most line of input is the left-most digit in the output. There are no spaces between the digits, and each digit is in the 0-5 range.
