		<p>
			<em>Distributed Computing</em> -- the use of a large network of computers to perform work together, could be an interesting field of Computer Science. Supercomputers are assembled as such closely connected networks. Alternatively, one could potentially create a larger network, and for cheaper, by letting individual computers contribute over a bigger network, such as the Internet (some might have heard of SETI@home). Since individual nodes are someone else's computer that run untrusted code, the results are also not trusted, so some verification needs to take place that the work performed is legit.

		<p>
			The input file <strong>DATA2.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of input, an odd integer 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 7 followed by N integers, 0 &lt;= R &lt;= 100 "results" for the same piece of work from N workers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The output file <strong>OUT2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, a decision about the performed work. If the majority of the results agree (that is, they are the same), then it is taken as <strong>verified</strong>. If there is no major consensus, but one result has more matches than any other result, then it is taken as <strong>unverified</strong>, otherwise the result is <strong>unknown</strong>. Print just the decision.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Note:</em> the majority (more than half) of 1 is 1, so a single result is always "verified".
