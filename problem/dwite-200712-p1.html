<div id="problem_title">Yet Another Primes Question</div>

<p>
Tony is busy writing his university exams, and thus lacks creativity. So he's making you write what you've already done in the last DWITE round, but differently. Instead of <em>semiprimes</em>, this time you're interested in numbers with 3 <strong>unique</strong> prime factors.
</p>
<p>
The input file <strong>DATA1.txt</strong> will contain five integers, one per line. 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000.
</p>
<p>
The output file <strong>OUT1.txt</strong> will contain five lines, stating if the supplied integers were <em>"valid"</em> or <em>"not"</em>. Use the exact string output, all lower case, without quotes.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Note:</em> You're looking for <strong>unique</strong> factors. For example, 12 has three prime factors: 2, 2, 3. But it's only two unique numbers: 2 and 3. Thus 12 is <em>not</em> what is asked for.
